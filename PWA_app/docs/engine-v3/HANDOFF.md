# Engine V3 — Current Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-22
Branch: `engine_v3`
Starting baseline: `10f3c40d70748ff27d6928eaed0875e10dab1c56`
Current source/test head: `b8327e033b96ab40f3568051dcdfaae107de50a0`

## Mission

Improve real Divar search result quality for professional users. The human owner is the independent product evaluator; the technical agent owns the implementation decisions and evidence process.

## Verified state
- `engine_v3` is isolated from `main`; no merge/deploy.
- Latest portable baseline [run #18](https://github.com/Nimadanesh/shakar/actions/runs/39682413600): focused tests PASS, full portable suite PASS, typecheck PASS, build PASS, ESLint FAIL (8 unrelated UI errors, 38 warnings).
- The three external-data historical research harnesses are still NOT RUN; their frozen inputs are not in the repository. Do not call them passed.
- Latest bounded read-only live observation [run #9](https://github.com/Nimadanesh/shakar/actions/runs/39682408569) completed successfully on Node 24.21.0, with four queries, at most two list pages and eight detail fetches per query, Mizan disabled.
- Confirmed fix 1: `پیانو دیجیتال یاماها طرح آکوستیک` changed from `exact` to `near` for `پیانو اکوستیک`; real acoustic-piano listings remained exact. Added a style-prefix check that is based on the listing title and respects the original query if the user explicitly asks for `طرح آکوستیک`. Tests cover both positive and counterexamples.
- Confirmed fix 2: `جک ماشین` and `کمک ماشین پراید` were live near-miss false positives for a whole-car hunt. Added these as bounded part markers. Pipeline test ensures these are rejected while a whole-car listing mentioning a jack stays eligible/exact. Latest live sample no longer shows those two part listings in the top results.
- The `کفی ماشین` bounded sample had three correct floor-mat exact results; some unrelated electronics were only near. The `تعمیر یخچال` sample showed service offers at the top. These observations do not prove general production quality.
- The explicit-absence sample correctly showed an explicitly `بی‌رنگ` car as exact and under-described paint cases as near.
- No human-grade comparison has been run for the new fixes. Do not claim contest-quality gains until fresh, consistent human top-K grades exist.
- Frozen R1 captures, pinned candidates, grades, mappings, and denominators remain immutable.

## Must preserve
- No `main` changes, merge, deployment, or service mutation without explicit authorization.
- No mutation or rerun of completed frozen evaluation artifacts.
- UNKNOWN remains distinct from satisfied/violated.
- No global synonym expansion or broad rewrite without paired evidence.
- Live observations are ungraded snapshots, not nDCG/precision metrics.

## Current phase
Phase 1 — two critical false-positive families have narrow fixes and deterministic regression tests. Portable tests/typecheck/build pass. Lint debt is unrelated UI work.

## Next action
Prepare a fresh, separately identified human evaluation of the current top results; preserve all frozen R1 data. Then run a controlled candidate/detail-budget experiment to quantify whether relevant candidates below the production cap are missed. Keep technical direction autonomous and ask the human evaluator only for result grades/observations when needed.
